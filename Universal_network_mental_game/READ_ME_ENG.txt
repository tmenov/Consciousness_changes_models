Universal network mental game. Adapted for the inhabitants of planet Earth-8, Gaia.

The daily spiritual attitude contributes to the physical and mental health of earthlings. This practice takes no more than 2 - 3 minutes, but you will notice the results after a week of daily practice. The practice takes no more than 2-3 minutes.
In the morning, after the body has awakened from sleep, relax and try to turn off the thinking generator and focus on the rhythm of the heart or the rhythm of breathing.
Say it silently or quietly in a servant voice.

I am the Universe
The Universe is me
The Power of the Universe is my Power
My Spirit is part of the stream of existence of all worlds
The power of my Spirit will be directed for the good of all beings arriving in all worlds and planes of existence
Reality in Truth will arrive.
And the lie in the illusion of perception will disappear forever.
My inner I, My Light, My Power, tell me what kind of changes in consciousness you want on my planet.

After that, stay in a relaxed state for about 1 minute and then continue your normal earthly rhythm of life.

We wish you that the fire of Souls that you feel will lead you to true spiritual knowledge that transforms your reality.
