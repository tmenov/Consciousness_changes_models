# Consciousness_changes_models

The Consciousness Change Models project was started by a group of enthusiasts in 1987.
Ultimately, all systems were combined into a single Biological KEY project. A mirror of this project is still available from the link on wix.com

The main idea of the project was the creation of a common mental network on the planet contributing to a single harmonious growth of earthlings as galactic civilization.
