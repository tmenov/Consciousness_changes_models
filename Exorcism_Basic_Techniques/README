Due to a number of objective reasons, my colleagues and I will not make the techniques of contact with low-vibrational astral entities and plasmoids hostile to human beings freely available.
However, instead we have prepared several practices (about 600) for removing bindings of certain entities or plasmoids.
This list will be constantly replenished.
The team of young scientists of Laboratory-7 proposed to prepare techniques for interaction with friendly plasmoids. 
In all probability, we will take into account the wishes of the group of young scientists and we will put the sessions with the application of these techniques in free access.
What is a session?
For a simple understanding, it is a meditation session. 
A session of concentration of mental, astral and psycho-physical energies of the human physical body, 
as well as of several energy bodies to correct the situation on the energetic plane and further projection of these changes on the physical body.
