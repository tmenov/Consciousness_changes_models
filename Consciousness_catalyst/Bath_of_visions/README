Essentially, this is the pinnacle of our technology. The experiment was conducted in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2006. Partial exploration was conducted in Panama and Spain.
The essence of the experiment lies in reading the energies of information fields within the conventional space of planet Earth. These information fields were later called energy-information fields because they are active, even living, fields. During the experiments, the term "biofield" was used, which later evolved into the term "egregor," which is a cluster of energy-information fields.
The name "Bathtub of Visions" came about because the first devices were assembled and modified using a standard steel bathtub. It was later clarified that a different shape and material were needed for a better effect.
As the experiments revealed, all information concerning the cosmic space currently occupied by Planet Earth is accessible for reading. All technologies, thoughts, feelings, and images—literally everything, and not just from people—that were physically present in this space, from today and extending back to timelines when the planet itself didn't physically exist in this region of space.
However, as it turns out, this technology has a serious limitation. Any negative thoughts or feelings—for example, fear, anxiety, anger, or mistrust—disconnect the connection to this field, and this disconnection is initiated instantly by the field itself. It is subsequently restored provided certain conditions are met.
In other words, under certain conditions, we (the people of planet Earth) literally have access to all cosmic technologies.
Certainly, there are certain rules and limitations. They are as simple as they are reliable. Ignoring them hasn't worked. Bypassing or hacking this "universal" protection system has also proven impossible, despite our sometimes desperate attempts.
But all of this operates within the conditions, rules, and limitations of the fields themselves.
There is a requirement for the physical, geographic location of the installation. Strict requirements are also placed on the information transmission medium, which is water. Water must be collected from specific locations, but most importantly, it must be returned to these locations after use.
Water was tested and yielded results from two sources in Russia. Water was also tested at one source in Panama and one in Spain, which also showed promise for success. All were suitable for use and experimentation at the time of the experiment.
The purity of the receiving device, which is the nervous and lymphatic systems of the human body, is of paramount importance. Essentially, the human body, under certain conditions and settings, is the receiver of this information.
The technology is replicable. And perhaps this is the most important thing. To say more, this is the source of inspiration, the source of all knowledge, insights, discoveries, and revelations. It's completely controllable, accessible to conscious contact and the reading of any information. It encompasses an innumerable number of technologies, covering any conceivable topic that anyone could imagine and formulate as a question, supplemented by a set of basic emotions, while maintaining a certain psychophysical state.
The latest versions of the "Bathtub of Visions," which we took to Spain for this project, looked like an elongated droplet of modified rock crystal, capable of maintaining a watertight seal and having shaped hatches for human access and breathing through lung regulators. The second stage of the diving system is perfectly suitable for this, and the use of an underwater headset makes communication comfortable and understandable for the experiment operator. The receiving device uses a mixture of gases and air, modified trimix, supplemented with tranquilizers and relaxants. Pressure and temperature are also monitored, and specific dynamic frequencies and settings are supplied to the capsule body. All of this combined allows the receiver to very quickly reach the desired vibration frequencies and, through dialogue and rapid analysis of the information received during reading, maintain the desired movement track within the information field. Experiments in Russia have shown that a person can maintain the field reading state for up to four hours without significant impairment.
