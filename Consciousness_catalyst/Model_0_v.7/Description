The addition of external magnetic fields and their synchronization in order to separate from the planet's 
magnetic field showed the possibility of the model being used as a receiver (and possibly a transmitter) of signals 
between planets with speeds many times the speed of light. 
This gave rise to the Hyperspace hypothesis found earlier in the Portal Generator models. 
We assumed that there is a certain boundary space (which we conditionally called Hyperspace), 
which is a connecting link in the fabric of the matter of the Universe, 
going out into this space is like going from home to street on a trip to a store and back home, 
while the transition to Hyperspace is not accompanied by destruction or splitting of matter as it happens in "wormholes". 
As a result of the experiment, model_0 suffered serious damage, apparently the materials used and their purity do not correspond to the vibration level. 
The experiments were continued on models 1, 2 and 3.
